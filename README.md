![Demo Animation](https://github.com/Clobie/Godot-2D-Shaders/blob/main/assets/Godot_v4.2.2-stable_win64_a2frezdB8q.gif?raw=true)

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of 2D shaders created for use with the Godot Engine. These shaders can be used to enhance the visual effects of 2D games and projects, providing a variety of effects such as color adjustments, distortions, and animations.

## Current Shaders

Here are some of the shaders currently included in this repository:

- **REF.gdshader:** A reference shader to demonstrate basic shader functionality.
- **acid.gdshader:** Creates an acid-like distortion effect.
- **chroma_offset.gdshader:** Applies a chromatic aberration effect.
- **distortion1.gdshader:** Adds a distortion effect.
- **fire1.gdshader:** Creates a fire effect.
- **greyscale.gdshader:** Converts the image to greyscale.
- **lightning.gdshader:** Generates a lightning effect.
- **pixel_dissolve.gdshader:** Creates a pixel dissolve transition effect.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Clobie/godot-2d-shaders.git
    cd godot-2d-shaders
    ```

2. Copy the desired shader files to your Godot project directory.

3. In Godot, create a new ShaderMaterial and load the shader file into the material.

## Usage

1. Open your Godot project and select the node to which you want to apply the shader.

2. Add a new ShaderMaterial to the node.

3. Load the desired shader file into the ShaderMaterial.

4. Adjust any shader parameters as needed to achieve the desired effect.
